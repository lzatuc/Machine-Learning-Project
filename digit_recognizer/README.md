This project aims to pick up Python and review machine learning models.

Leverage a couple of machine learning methods to classify handwritten digits, common methods including naive bayes, knn, logistic regression, svm, decision tree, gradient boosted decision tree, random forest, neural network, deep neural network will be implemented. Ensemble methods bagging and boosting will also be used to further imporve the model performance. A couple of measuring merics will be applied here, including accuracy, recall, f-measure, ROC, AUC, etc.

For some methods, I'll try to implement from scratch to review the idea behind it, as well as address common issues like overfitting, regularization, cross-validation, gradient descent optimization, etc. Meanwhile, libraries in Python, including Numpy, Pandas, scikit-learn will also be utilized, in order to become familiar with them, which is quite beneficial in the long run. Also, I'll try to load the data into database and write db connector, rather than read them from file each time.

Although the data is well extracted and organized, I'll try different transformation on it, including standardization, normalization, PCA, LDA, etc to see how these pre-processing affect the final outcome.

Later, I'll provide R version of some methods.
